# OpenAI Speed Tests
Hi! I decided to collect data to provide devs with information on what makes the OpenAI API fast & slow. I am currently collecting as much data as I can to analyze every GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 model out there.
## Setup:
- Create .env file with your own OpenAI API Key

## Generate Maps:
- call either heatmap.py or 3d_surface_plot.py to generate data.

## 3d_surface_plot example:
